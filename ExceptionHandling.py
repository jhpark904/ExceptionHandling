    """The program does the following:
    1) asks the user to input a filename (supposedly in the same folder as this program)
	2) reads the numbers (type int) in the file (filename given by the user in previous step) and stores them into a list
	3) prints the minimum, the maximum and the average of the numbers (2 decimal places for the average)
    
    Note: your program should be impossible to crash. Think about all the possibilities to make your program crash.
    If one of the steps throws an exception, display a message to the user and your program should loop back to step 1."""
